        <p class="card-text">Welcome to the website, where you can experience stories through multiple media formats, all within a single narrative.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Imagine starting a story as a video, but then deciding you'd rather listen to it while on the go. With this platform, you can switch between different media types such as audio, images, and text, each offering a unique perspective on the narrative.</p>
        <p class="card-text">For example, let's say you begin watching a video about an adventure. However, you're busy and would prefer to listen to it instead. You can effortlessly switch to the audio version, and it will start playing at the exact moment where you left off in the video.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Similarly, if you prefer to visualize the story through images or read it in text form, you have the flexibility to switch to those formats as well, allowing you to engage with stories in a way that suits your preferences and circumstances.</p>
